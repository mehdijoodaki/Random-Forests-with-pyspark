# Random-Forests-with-pyspark

This code focuses on building Random Forests (RF) with PySpark for
classification.
Random forests are made up of many trees: a lot of decision trees.  Random forests can also be used for classification and regression. 
They combine votes from a lot of individual
decision trees and then predict the class with majority votes or take the average in case of regression. This works really well because the weak 
learners eventually group together to make strong predictions.
